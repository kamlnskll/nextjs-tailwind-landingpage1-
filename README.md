# nextjs-tailwind-landingpage1-

This project is my very first project built completely without video tutorial using Next.JS and TailWindCSS - the actual site content is completely satirical as you will see if you decide to check it out.

The inspiration behind this extremely basic landing page was to put the rubber to the road as they say, and to get some hands on practice with NextJS and React components, working with JSX and Tailwind together, and using basic JSON to map customer testimonials into each testimonial card, but also with a POST request in the checkout page.

 As of right now, my knowledge surround best UX/UI practices is virtually zero and this is one area that I will focus on improving moving forward for my next projects, because I think some minor adjustments to my elements/components of the site would look better.
 
 For my next project, I will focus on learning and implementing at least a few (3-4) elements, whether that be buttons, lists, info cards etc, according to these best practices. Secondly, I want to up the complexity - likely I will try to create a blog/content website that connects to a Headless CMS such as Wordpress or GraphCMS (along the same idea as the other blog I uploaded to my GitHub, except this time without a tutorial and with my own design.) or maybe something less extensive like some sort of CRUD list app. I still plan to update this landing page, but the frequency will be unknown.
